Title: Advanced Home Automation and Security System

Description: This project implements a smart home system using an Arduino to automate various security measures such as a fingerprint door lock, fire alarm, and water tank overflow alarm.

Features:
Fingerprint Door Lock: Biometric authentication using fingerprint to secure the home.
Phone Call Fire Alarm: Alerts the user via phone in case of a fire.
Water Tank Overflow Alarm: Monitors water tank levels and alerts the user when the tank is full.

Technologies Used:
Arduino UNO
Fingerprint sensor, Ultrasonic sensors
C++ for Arduino code

Instructions:
Steps to set up the system (connecting components, loading the code).
Circuit diagrams and parts list.
The Fingerprint checking code is located in the `fingerprint check.io` file.
The water level detection &fire detection code is located in the `water_lvl_us_fir.io` file.
